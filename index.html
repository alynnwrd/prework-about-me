      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 29-years-old and am currently working as the Communication Arts Director at Pax Christi Church in Eden Prairie, MN. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm originally from North East Pennsylvania but grew up largely between South Eastern Michigan and the Southwest Suburbs of the Twin Cities.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Traveling has always been something I enjoy. I've had the great privilege of being able to travel to England, France, Italy, Spain, and Thailand. I hope to soon be able to visit a friend who is currently living in Japan! I love to read. Fantasy and Fiction books are my go to, but I will read almost anything! I have several friends who are writers and I will often act as an early editor for their work. I also love cooking and baking. I don't think there is a better way to show your love for family and friends than making a great meal for them to enjoy!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to work somewhere where I am actively helping people and making their lives better.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I'm living in Chanhassen, MN with my best friend from high school and her two cats, Taco and Jasper.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>With my current role at my job, I am now in charge of our website. This is an important way that we use to connect with the larger community, especially since the COVID-19 Pandemic. It will also be a great skill to have, no matter where I end up working.</p>
